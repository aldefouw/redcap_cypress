Feature: Assign User Rights

  As a REDCap end user, I want to see that:
  - The system allows the ability to add, edit or delete the following core user privileges:
  --- 2. Expiration Date
  --- 3. Project Design and Setup
  --- 4. User Rights
  --- 6. Data Access Groups
  --- 7. Data Export Tool
  --- 8. Add/Edit Records
  --- 9. Survey Distribution Tools
  --- 10. Data Import Tool
  --- 11. Data Comparison Tool
  - The system allows data entry form user access to be:
  --- 

  # Notes:
  # - Manual script says to verify that green check or red X appears after adding/removing rights, but
  #   this is not currently done. A step definition for this could be implemented relatively easily,
  #   but I've opted to skip it for now, until a determination that it is necessary is made. A similar
  #   type of assertion is skipped for expiration dates, where "never" is expected to appear in the table.

  Scenario: Project Setup - 1
    Given I am an "admin" user who logs into REDCap
    And I create a project named "AssignUserRightsProject" with project purpose Practice / Just for fun via CDISC XML import from fixture location "cdisc_files/core/07_DesignForms_v1115.xml"

    And I check the checkbox labeled "Enable the Field Comment Log or Data Resolution Workflow (Data Queries)?"
    And I click on the button labeled "Save"

    # but there are no instruments or records.
